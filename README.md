# Humanoid_Robot_Project
This repository is dedicated to my humanoid robot project. This Work-In-Progress project consists of the creation of a robot between 5 and 6 feet tall, 
capable of moving using a differential drive motor configuration, designed to allow for faster and more energy efficient movement than normal bipedal walking robots. 
It also uses this configuration to reduce the complexity of the robot whilst providing the weight control benefits that bipedal legs can provide.
This robot also contains components capable of offline speech synthesis, speech recognition and computer vision for human facial recognition and detection.
As for now, the repository serves to display images of the current 3D model as it has been developed up to now, however as the model is near-completed, production of the components
is underway and videos of its facial tracking and other features will be added when tested.
